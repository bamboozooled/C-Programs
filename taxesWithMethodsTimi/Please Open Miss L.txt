Hello Mrs L, I forgot to submit my IPO chart to your mailbox but took 
a picture of it. Please remember we did it together so you know I did it
before the due date but couldnt find it in class. I dont know if you can 
mark it then record, then ill give you the paper in class on Monday. 

You also said I should remind you to update the lesson 12 assignment you 
changed the grade of in class. And also remember my strings program.

Thank You, Timi
